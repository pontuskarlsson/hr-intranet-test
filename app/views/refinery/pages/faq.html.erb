    { question: "Why do I need Quality Control?", answer: "For visibility and brand protection.  Quality control is a critical step in the process of total quality assurance.  Quality issues are identified at the factory before goods are shipped, meaning that you don't pay for defective goods and you avoid the cost and headaches involved in resolving claims post shipment.  By conducting inline inspections, you can identify problems in production and anticipate delays in good time, allowing you and the factory to respond more flexibly.   Finally, by analysing quality data over time you can gain insights into repeated issues and defects, anticipate issues and work with your suppliers to resolve them." },
    { question: "Why should I use Happy Rabbit for Quality Control?", answer: "Our QC inspectors are specialised in apparel, footwear and accessories.  They undergo extensive training with a  focus on conducting inspections at the level required for premium product.  We offer a high level of visibility to our customers.  Inspection reports are issued within 24 hours of the inspection being conducted.  All reports and documents are delivered and stored centrally and are accessible at the touch of a button via our customers' personalised portal.  For customers signed up to a monthly plan, we help to analyse historical defect and delivery data and work with factories and buyers to come up with Corrective Action Plans (CAP) for specific issues and processes - valuable information that can help you achieve your overall quality objectives." },
    { question: "What types of products do you inspect?", answer: "We specialise in performing quality inspections of premium apparel, footwear and accessories items" },
    { question: "How much do your QC services cost?", answer: "If you are one of our service plan customers, Quality is included in the monthly fee which also covers sourcing, design, development, logistics and production.  If you are accessing our Quality services on their own, you can find a pricing list on the Quality page. Prices are quoted per man day required to execute an inspection.  Prices range from USD 350 /manday for a single inspection booking to USD 308/month base on our X-Large monthly plan." },
    { question: "What happens if I don't use up all my mandays for a certain month?", answer: "If the minimum number of mandays is not used up for a particular month, vouchers will be issued and automatically redeemed in subsequent months" },
    { question: "I urgently need to arrange an inspection.

    { question: "How do I pay?", answer: "For prepaid inspections, you can pay online with a credit card.  We accept Visa, MasterCard, Maestro and American Express.

Here you can upload your PO and style overview. We will then estimate the number of Mandays required to carry out inspections on those POs." },
    { question: "What information does your inspection report include?", answer: "Our inline and endline inspection reports state all product specifications, inspection requirements/standards, sample size, inspector name, number of defects per type and overall result as a summary.  The report also gives details of the production status of the shipment, including the quantity of pieces that have been sewn, pressed or packed at the time of inspection.  We check the shipment for conformity to specifications and approved samples (materials, garment, finishing, washing, packaging, packing methods), product function, appearance and measurements/fit.   All issues, defects and comments are outlined and accompanied by photos within the report." },
    { question: "In which countries do you perform inspections?", answer: "We manage our own Quality Control teams servicing China, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. We also operate in other regions depending on the particular project and customer, including South Asia, Europe, Africa, Middle East and the Americas" },
    { question: "What is AQL? ", answer: "In a nutshell, AQL (Acceptable Quality Limit) is a standard used to decide on a sample size to be randomly inspected and the number of critical, major and minor defects that are allowed for an inspection to be \"approved\".  These decisions are based on the total order size as well as the inspection level required. AQL is widely used in the garment industry as a cost-effective and reliable way to predict the defect rate of a shipment as a whole and is a methodology that is preferred to 100% inspection due to time and cost savings.  The below chart outlines the main criteria and method for determining the inspection sample size required and the number of allowable defects based on the most widely used AQL standards of 2.5 for major defects and 4 for minor defects (note that critical defects should be zero).      Taking the example of an order of 5,000 pieces, based on General inspection level II, the sample size for inspection is 200 pieces,  the maximum acceptable number of major defects is 10 and the maximum acceptable number of minor defects is 14.     If you want to get in touch for more information about AQL and our inspection methodologies, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@happyrabbit.com\">hello@happyrabbit.com</a>." },
    { question: "Why use AQL instead of conducting a 100% inspection?", answer: "It's too time consuming and costly to inspect an entire order, particularly for larger shipments.  The AQL sample inspection method is  very cost effective and results in a very clear guide regarding the state of your shipment.  The inspector will select garments from different cartons to ensure that the samples are representative of the whole order.  Orders are never inspected based on samples pre-prepared by the suppliers.   Based on the results of an AQL inspection, buyers are in a good position to make an informated decision regarding whether or not the shipment as a whole is of acceptable quality." },
    { question: "Is AQL a guarantee of zero defects in my shipment?", answer: "An AQL sample inspection will not guarantee zero defects.  However, inspections are structured in such a way as to provide a very good guide regarding the quality level of the order as a whole and to allow buyers to make informed decisions regarding shipment approvals without the very high cost of conducting 100% inspections." },
    { question: "What happens in case of a reject report?", answer: "When a shipment is deemed to be rejected, we will work quickly with the factory and the buyer and guide them towards the best solution. We are currently implementing an \"on hold\" status for our inspections to describe shipments that are rejected but can be fixed through corrective action procedures and/or repair. At the end of a project or season for our customers on monthly plans we conduct a KPI analysis with regards to defects, identify systemic problems and come up with corrective action plans (CAP) for improvement which we work on with both the buyer and the factory. " },
    { question: "Which plan is best for me?", answer: "Your choice of plan will depend on the volume of continuous inspection work your business will require. The more inspections you sign up for per month the better discount you can get. It is also possible to upgrade your plan should you find that your needs aren't covered" },
    { question: "Can I change my plan?", answer: "Yes, you can upgrade to another plan at any time within your contract period." },
    { question: "Do you do lab tests?", answer: "We do not perform lab tests except for customers on a wider service plan which also covers sourcing, design, development, production and logistics.  We work with all the major labs. " },
    { question: "Do you do factory audits?", answer: "We help build and establish supply chains for our customers.  Part of that process is visiting and assessing factories.  We perform our own internal audits but always engage third parties to conduct official audits." },
    { question: "Who will approve or reject the shipment?", answer: "We give our opinion and guidance based on industry standards and experience.  However, the customer will always have the final say.  If we issue a report that states \"approved\", the customer should always seek to understand the reasons for this allocation.  We are currently implementing a third status result -  shipment on hold -  which will allow us to more clearly communicate with the customer possible corrective action plans for any shipment that cannot be immediately approved." },
    { question: "Where do I send the approved Pre-Production samples?", answer: "It depends on what has been agreed with the factory and the customer. Usually the buyer sends the pre-production samples to the factory directly but the parcel will be marked for our attention and unopened except by our inspectors." },
    { question: "What is the process for inspections?", answer: "" },
    { question: "Would I be better off signing up for a service plan?", answer: "If you are buying a larger number of inspections per month, you could well benefit from our wider service plan which includes Quality Control.  Quality assurance benefits include early risk assessment and continuous tracking from concept through development and into bulk production." },
